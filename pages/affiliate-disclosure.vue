          <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
          <p>Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a commission when you purchase a product or service after clicking on our link. These links help us maintain this website and continue providing valuable content to our readers.</p>

          <h2>Our Affiliate Relationships</h2>

          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
          <p>When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may receive a commission. This commission:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does NOT increase the price you pay for the product or service</li>
            <li>Helps us maintain and improve our website</li>
            <li>Allows us to continue creating valuable content and reviews</li>
            <li>Supports our research and testing of software products</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
          <p>We want to assure you that our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content. Here's our commitment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> All our reviews are based on genuine testing and experience with the software</li>
            <li><strong>Unbiased Opinions:</strong> We provide both positive and negative aspects of each product</li>
            <li><strong>Real Testing:</strong> We actually use the software we review for extended periods</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent Ratings:</strong> Our ratings are based on objective criteria, not commission rates</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Recommendations:</strong> We often recommend free or lower-commission alternatives when appropriate</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Commission Structure</h2>
          <p>Different affiliate programs offer different commission structures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Recurring Commissions:</strong> Some programs (like ConvertKit, SEMrush) pay ongoing commissions for active subscriptions</li>
            <li><strong>One-time Commissions:</strong> Others pay a single commission for each sale</li>
            <li><strong>Bounty Programs:</strong> Some (like Shopify) offer fixed amounts for qualified referrals</li>
            <li><strong>Percentage-based:</strong> Most programs pay a percentage of the sale amount</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
          <p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, we clearly disclose our affiliate relationships:</p>

          </ul>
